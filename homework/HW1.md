## Homework 1

Please answer the below questions. A homework has been created in Moodle. Compose and 
submit answers there. The homework on Moodle will open Friday, Aug 24 at 5 pm, and close 
Friday, Aug 31 at 5 pm. We will discuss the homework in the Sept 4. class period. Feel free to
use the class notebooks to test out answers for this homework!

1. 

Command 1:
```
my_number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_number_list.append(6)
```

Command 2:
```
my_number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_number_list.insert(5, 2)
```

What is the difference between these two commands?  

2. 

```
surveys_df[(surveys_df.year >= 1980) & (surveys_df.year <= 1985)]
```

How could you modify the above command select only a subset of columns?

3.

Which type of join will return the smallest subset of data, and why?

4. How could you modify the `yearly_data_csv_writer()` function from Aug 28 class to write out
only one year of data? Which function, `yearly_data_csv_writer()` or `one_year_csv_writer` would we have
to modify to get monthly data?

5. Why do we need `yearly_data_csv_writer()`? Why not just split up the raw file?

6. What is the difference between printing something to the screen, and returning it from a function?
