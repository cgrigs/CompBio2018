    "Every programmer encounters errors, both those who are just beginning, and those who have been programming for years. Encountering errors and exceptions can be very frustrating at times, and can make coding feel like a hopeless endeavour. However, understanding what the different types of errors are and when you are likely to encounter them can help a lot. Once you know why you get certain types of errors, they become much easier to fix.\n",

Inside this function, the program encountered an error on Line 6, when it tried to run the code `print(ice_creams[3])`.\n",

    "So what error did the program actually encounter? In the last line of the traceback, Python helpfully tells us the category or type of error (in this case, it is an `IndexError`) and a more detailed error message (in this case, it says `list index out of range`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error and don’t know what it means, it is still important to read the traceback closely. That way, if you fix the error, but encounter a new one, you can tell that the error changed. Additionally, sometimes just knowing where the error occurred is enough to fix it, even if you don’t entirely understand the message.\n",
